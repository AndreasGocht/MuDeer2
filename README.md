# MuDeer2 - A Mumble Bot using DeepSpeech for voice recognition

MuDeer2 is a Mumble Bot, which uses pymumble and DeepSpeech.
MuDeer2 relates either to "My Dear" or to "**MU**mble **DEE**pspeech **R**ecognition". However you whish :smile: .
I chose to simplify things a bit to allow a better Telegram integration. Therefore I created MuDeer2 out of MuDeer.

You need to rename and adjust the `config.default.cfg` to `config.cfg`.

Moreover, to use voice recognition, you need voice models and scorers for DeepSpeech:
* English models can be found: https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases
* Other Languages: https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/links-to-pretrained-models/62688 

Feel free to open an issue if you do have any questions ;-).
